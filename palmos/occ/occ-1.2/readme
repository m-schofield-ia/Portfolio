One Click Clipping
==================



Legal Stuff:

The One Click Clipping suite of programs (OCC) comes as is - if it breaks you get to keep both pieces.  OCC is free to use.



To install the One Click Clipping Manager (OCC Man):

1) Start the standard Palm Install tool.
2) Select 'Add'.
3) Browse to 'occman.prc'.  Highlight 'occman.prc' and press 'open'.
4) Make sure that the Hotsync Manager is running.
5) Insert your Palm in the Craddle and start Hotsync.



OCC can be found at:

Instructions on how to create One Click Clippings can also be found
on that site.




Thanks for using OCC
