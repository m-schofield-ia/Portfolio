<DL>
<DT CLASS="occ">Is One Click Clipping really free?</DT>
<DD>Yes. One Click Clipping is free in the sense that you don't have to pay me any money at all - use it and be happy :-)
<DT CLASS="occ">So, what license comes with One Click Clipping?</DT>
<DD>Short answer: none. It comes as-is. &nbsp; Long answer: It comes as-is. If it breaks you get to keep both pieces. Ok?</DD>
<DT CLASS="occ">What happens - I delete one OCC and they all go?</DT>
<DD>Yes. If you delete a standalone OCC executable they all go. Use <I>OCCMan</I> to delete individual OCCs - it is all documented in the User Manual :-)</DD>
