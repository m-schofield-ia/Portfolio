</TR></TABLE>
<P>Trams for Palm OS uses some of the Trams Mobile files. However, they must be converted to Trams for Palm OS before use. I would have loved to include a set of converted files but as they change from country to country - and also from time to time - it seems pointless to do so.
<P>(If a co-worker already has done this, then just get his/hers database file - it's much easier :-)

<P><BR><P>
<H3>Update Trams Mobile</H3>
<P>Run the Refresh batch job from the Trams folder. It will refresh the various files, thus giving you a fresh set of data.

<P><BR><P>
<H3>Convert Database</H3>
<P>Run the <B>TramsCvt</B> program for the Trams for Palm OS suite (pictures opens in separate windows).
<P><A HREF="javascript:OpenWindow(1)"><IMG SRC="gfx/wizard1s.jpg" WIDTH="136" HEIGHT="119" ALT="Wizard 1: Welcome screen"></A>
<P><BR>The welcome screen.

<P><A HREF="javascript:OpenWindow(2)"><IMG SRC="gfx/wizard2s.jpg" WIDTH="136" HEIGHT="104" ALT="Wizard 2: Data Collection"></A>
<P><BR>Data Collection screen. Enter the full path to the <I>expcat.dat</I> file in the Trams Mobile folder in the <B>Trams Mobile Expenses Category Database</B> field (or use the <B>Browse...</B> button).
<P>Enter the output path in the <B>Palm Database Output Path</B> (or use the <B>Browse...</B> button).
<P>On Microsoft Windows you also have the choice to queue the database files for HotSync during the conversion. Tick the <B>Install to Palm Profile</B> checkbox and select the target profile in the drop down list.

<P>TramsCvt will work a bit and ...

<P><BR>Everything usually runs smooth ... sometimes you get errors but then go back and retry the conversion process.

<P><BR><P>
<H3>What To Do Then?</H3>
<P>On Microsoft Windows you have the option to queue the database files for HotSync during the conversion process. If you de-select this option you have to manually queue the database file - it will be transferred on next HotSync.
<!-- <P>On non-Microsoft Windows you have to manually install the database file stored in the output path to your handheld by whatever means you normally uses to install prc/pdb files. --><!-- Heh .. Trams for Palm OS is not yet available for Linux :-) -->
