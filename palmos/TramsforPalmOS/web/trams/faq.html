<DT>I am employed by HP German/UK/Norway/... - can I still use Trams for Palm OS?</DT>
<DD>Yes. Provided that HP in your country uses Trams :-) Also, in some countries some of the Expense categories demands more information to be filled out. You cannot do that in Trams for Palm OS.</DD>

<DT>I am a Linux/Mac OS user - can I use Trams for Palm OS?</DT>
<DD>The short answer is: <B>No</B>. The long answer is: <B>Yes</B>, you can use Trams for Palm OS. However, it would be rather pointless as there is no tool to convert the TERs to .exp for these platforms.</DD>

<DT>Ehrm, I am still unsure about this whole thing. I've installed Trams for Palm OS on my device. I've created some TERs and added expenses to these. What now?</DT>
<DD>Cool - you're almost there! HotSync your device. After a successful HotSync you will find some .exp files in the drop directory you specified in the HotSync Trams conduit (see the <A HREF="manual/install.html">Installation Guide</A>). These .exp files can be imported to Trams Mobile and Trams for further processing, such as sending the whole she-bang to Accounting. When satisfied you really should lock the TER on your device or delete it.</DD>

<DT>A rumour has it that Denmark will replace Trams with ESS - what is your position on that?</DT>
<DD>Well, I don't know what ESS looks like. If possible, I'd like to extend Trams for Palm OS to handle ESS as well. But HP being HP, ESS will probably not be anything like Trams. I will try to support Trams for Palm OS for as long as I can.</DD>

<DT>What about Per Diem/Extra Input?</DT>
<DD>I would love to support it. However, it really is a pain in the *** as I cannot directly test it. So clearly some help is needed!</DD>

<DT>Is there anything I can do?</DT>
<DD>Yes. Definitely! I could need some extra hands helping with the code. Also, the .exp format is incompletely reverse engineered - it needs to be clarified.</DD>
