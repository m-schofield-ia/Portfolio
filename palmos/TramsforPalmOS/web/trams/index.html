<P>The expenses claim system used in HP Denmark (and EMEA in general) is called Trams. Trams comes in two flavours - one full version which lets you register just about anything and a mobile (or slim) version which lets you register the most common expenses.
<P>Trams for Palm OS is an even slimmer version. It only lets you register expenses - no Per Diem and no fancy expenses can be registered. However, this works in Denmark as we only need to register the amount spent and what the money was spent on.
