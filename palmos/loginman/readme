LoginMan
========



Legal Stuff:

LoginMan comes as is - if it breaks you get to keep both pieces.   LoginMan
is free to use.



To install LoginMan:

1) Start the standard Palm Install tool.
2) Select 'Add'.
3) Browse to 'qalm.prc'.  Highlight 'qalm.prc' and press 'open'.
4) Make sure that the Hotsync Manager is running.
5) Insert your Palm in the Craddle and start Hotsync.



LoginMan can be found at:

Instructions for how to integrate LoginMan and PQAs (Palm Query Applications)
can also be found on that site.




Thanks for using LoginMan.
