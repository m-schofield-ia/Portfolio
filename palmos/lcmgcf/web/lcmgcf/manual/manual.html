<H1>LcmGcf User Manual</H1>
<P><BR>
<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>In LcmGcf you practice solving LCMs and GCFs of two or three numbers. LCM is the Least Common Multiple and GCF is the Greatest Common Factor.
<P>You setup the characteristica of the quiz - if it should be timed, what kind of operations you'd like, sizes of the operands and the like. LcmGcf will then display a LCM or a GCF for you to solve. LcmGcf keeps tracks of your successes and failures.
<P>The Last 10 scores can be exported to Memo Pad.

<H3>Installation</H3>
<P>Installation of LcmGcf is like installing any other Palm OS program:
<OL>
<LI>Download [<A HREF="#refs">1</A>] LcmGcf.
<LI>Unpack the <B>LcmGcf.zip</B> archive using WinZip [<A HREF="#refs">2</A>] or UnZip [<A HREF="#refs">3</A>].
<LI>Start the standard Palm Install tool. Select 'Add', then browse to where you unpacked the archive. Highlight the <B>LcmGcf.prc</B> file and select 'Open'. Then select 'Done'.
<LI>Start the HotSync Manager if it is not running.
<LI>Insert your Palm PDA in the craddle, then press the HotSync button on the craddle.
</OL>
<P>When the synchronization is done you will have a 'LcmGcf' icon in the <I>Unfiled</I> category on your Palm PDA. Feel free to move LcmGcf to another category.

<H3>Using LcmGcf</H3>
<P><IMG SRC="gfx/lcmgcf.gif" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="160" ALT="LcmGcf">When starting LcmGcf you will be presented with a short menu. Select <B>Preferences</B> to set the characteristicas of the quiz. Select <B>Beam Preferences</B> to beam the preferences settings to another device. Select <B>Show Scores</B> to view the <I>Last 10 Scores</I>. Select <B>Clear Scores</B> to clear the <I>Last 10 Scores</I> list - you will be asked to confirm your action. Select <B>Start Quiz</B> to start the quiz.

<P><BR><IMG SRC="gfx/preferences.gif" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="160" ALT="Preferences">The quiz is setup using the controls on the <I>Preferences</I> screen. First select the <B>Quiz Type</B>. You can choose between <I>LCM</I>, <I>GCF</I> or <I>Random</I>. In <I>LCM</I> mode you have to find the <B>Least Common Multiple</B> of two or three numbers. In <I>GCF</I> mode you have to find the <B>Greatest Common Factor</B> of two or three numbers. In <I>Random</I> mode the handheld will randomly determine the quiz for you to take.
<P>Select how many numbers will be involved in the quiz - 2 or 3. Select the max size of each operand.
<P>Select what kind of <I>Scoring</I> should be used. If you select <B>First Guess</B> then a point will only be scored if the first guess is correct. If <B>Correct Guess</B> is chosen, then a point will be scored whenever a correct answer is given. The former is more restrictive.
<P>Select if the quiz should be timed. A blank <B>Timed</B> field or a value of <I>0</I> disable the timer. Other values enable the timer for that many minutes.

<P><BR><IMG SRC="gfx/main.gif" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="160" ALT="Quiz">When running the quiz you will get a display looking like a simple calculator. The buttons on the right, from top to bottom are: <B>backspace</B>, <B>clear all</B>, <B>help</B> and <B>OK</B> (submit the answer). In the upper right corner you have a button to end the current quiz. In a timed game the time remaining will be shown between the <B>0</B> and <B>OK</B> buttons (not shown). When you press a button the time seems halt; but fear not - the timer is counted down in the background and as soon as you release the button the timer will catch up. 

<P><BR><IMG SRC="gfx/help.gif" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="160" ALT="Help">During the quiz you can get a bit of help on the current problem. Press the Help button (the questionmark button). A short descriptive text of what to solve is shown and also examples of quiz types are shown. In the upper left corner a count of how many times the help was used is shown.

<P><BR><IMG SRC="gfx/quizover.gif" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="160" ALT="Quiz Over">When the quiz is over you wil get a chance to enter your name for the <B>Last 10 Scores</B> list. Select <B>Save Score</B> to save the score. Select <B>Don't Save Score</B> to go to the main form without saving the score.

<P><BR><IMG SRC="gfx/scores.gif" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="160" ALT="Last 10 Scores">The <B>Last 10 Scores</B> list lists the last 10 scores (whoah!) The list is not to be taken as a High Score list. Tap an entry to view the details for that entry. Select <B>Export</B> to export the list to Memo Pad.

<P><BR><IMG SRC="gfx/details.gif" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="160" ALT="Details">A detailed view of a randomly chosen entry. This view contains scores, rounds and the selected preferences for the quiz. This is more less how each entry in the Export list will look like.
