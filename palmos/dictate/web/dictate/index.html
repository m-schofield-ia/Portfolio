<H1>Dictate v1.5</H1>
<P><IMG SRC="dictate.jpg" WIDTH="244" HEIGHT="340" ALT="Dictate"><i>Dictate</I> is a tool to aid in dictation. A teacher creates a group of sentences and reads the sentences out to a class of students. Each student enters the sentences as the student believes they should be spelled. <I>Dictate</I> keeps scores and at the end of the dictation the student gets a chance to view the correct answers. Furthermore, the score can be saved and printed out using <I>Diploma</I> (see below).
<P><I>Dictate</I> was created as a response to the wishlist found at: <A HREF="http://www.mpsomaha.org/willow/technology/wishlist.html">http://www.mpsomaha.org/willow/technology/wishlist.html</A>.
<P><I>Dictate</I> is released under the GNU General Public License v2 and requires Palm OS 3.0 or better.
