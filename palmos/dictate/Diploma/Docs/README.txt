Diploma
=======
 

Diploma is a simple program to read and format the Dictate Scores file so that
it can be printed.
After a succesful Dictation Session students can save their results. The results
will be transferred to the desktop PC on the next HotSync.   Open Diploma,
locate the Dictate Score file and hit print.  If more scores are present you
have the choice to select the score to print.


To un-install Diploma:

Use the "Add or Remove Programs" utility in the control panel.


Legal Stuff:

Diploma comes as is - if it breaks you get to keep both pieces.
Diploma is free to use.  Look in LICENSE.txt for legalities.
