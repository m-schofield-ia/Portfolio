Diplomas
--------


The diploma is based on a simple HTML file. The html file must be placed
in the Diploma installation directory (typically c:\Program Files\Schau.Com\
Dictate\Diploma\vXrY\).
The html file must be named as you want it to look in the drop down box and
the file must end in .htm.   F.ex., the Standard Diploma is called:

	Standard Diploma.htm

When Diploma starts it searchs the installation directory for any .htm files.
The suffix is stripped from the name and the name is added to the drop down
list.

The html file can contain whatever information you want.  Diploma will search
and replace the following strings:

Key		Replacement
@@SCORE@@	The users score.
@@ROUND@@	Number of rounds in the dictation session.
@@NAME@@	User name.
@@GROUP@@	Group name.
@@PCT@@		Percentage ((score*100)/rounds).
@@YEAR@@	The year part of when the dictation was done.
@@MONTH@@	The month part of when the dictation was done.
@@DAY@@		The day part of when the dictation was done.
@@BASE@@	Base directory of the Diploma (used to locate graphics).

The final page will be shown in the system wide default browser.
