<DD>The Body Mass Index (BMI) is an objective measure that can help you decide whether your weight is right for you or not. BMI is a figure calculated from your height and weight and can be used to determine if you are overweight, underweight or at a healthy weight.</DD>
<DT>Cool! So how is that magic number calculated?</DT>
<DD>Depends ... if you are using the metric system then it is <B>weight / height * height</B> (height is in meters)</DD>
<DT>... and?</DT>
<DD>If you are using pounds and inches then it is: <B>weight * 704.5 / height * height</B> (height is in inches)</DD>
<DT>So ... what is it good for?</DT>
<DD>If your BMI checks out in the range <B>20 - 24.9</B> you're at a healthy weight. Below <B>20</B> you're underweight. <B>25</B> or higher, you're overweight.</DD>
