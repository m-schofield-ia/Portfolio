<H1>El, Gas, Vand-2.2</H1>
<P><IMG SRC="egv.jpg" WIDTH="244" HEIGHT="340" ALT="El, Gas, Vand">Every month I record the current state of my electricity, gas and water meters. Normally I record them on a web page on my website. But then I got the striking idea of hacking this little program.
<P>It really doesn't do anything useful. Yet. I plan to be able to export the data to csv for later manipulation in Excel or OpenOffice Spreadsheet.
<P>But that is the future .... :-)
<P><I>El, Gas, Vand</I> was made for danish meters. However, the program has been translated to english.
