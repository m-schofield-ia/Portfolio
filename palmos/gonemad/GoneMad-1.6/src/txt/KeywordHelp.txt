The more creative words you enter for keywords, the crazier the story will turn out! Keywords can be anything. Although you can enter anything you want for the descriptions of keywords, below are common descriptions to help you fill in Gone Mad! templates and for assistance in creating your own.

[Noun]
A noun names a person, place, or thing. Nouns that name only one person, place, or thing are singular. Nouns that name more than one are plural. Most people assume that when a story template asks for a noun, it is singular. Otherwise, the story template will ask for a "plural noun."

[Verb]
Verbs are words that express action or state of being. For Gone Mad! you probably won't use state of being verbs. Like nouns, verbs can be singular and plural.
