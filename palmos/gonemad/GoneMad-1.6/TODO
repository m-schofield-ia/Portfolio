"Just for fun, when I put my templates in my computer years ago, I set up a "word list" of sample words for each category - if I wanted to be lazy and just fill in some random words in each category, I had a button I could click and the software would do that for me.  The results were often funnier than I would have come up with, since the sample word file contained stuff that I put into it after careful thought - such as the category "City" contains cities that mean something to me, so when a story shows up with a nearby city as a town with lots of quicksand or hobos, it adds to the humor.  Hey, maybe that's WAY beyond the reach of this app, but I thought I'd mention it just for fun... :-)"
