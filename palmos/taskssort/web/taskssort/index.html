<H1>TasksSort v1.0</H1>
<P><IMG SRC="taskssort.jpg" WIDTH="244" HEIGHT="340" ALT="TasksSort">The builtin Tasks PIM in Palm OS 5 lacks the ability to sort the tasks list by description. <I>TasksSort</I> gives you the ability to sort the tasks list ascending or descending by description. <I>TasksSort</I> somewhat integrates with the Tasks program - you can launch <I>TasksSort</I> from Tasks and when the list is sorted go directly back to Tasks.
<P><I>TasksSort</I> is released under the GNU General Public License v2 and requires Palm OS 5.0 or better to work.
