<H1>Recal v2.8</H1>
<P><IMG SRC="recal.jpg" WIDTH="244" HEIGHT="340" ALT="Recal"><I>Recal</I> is a quick hack I use when my Palm loses its digitizer settings. This unfortunately happens once in a while (and after every reset!).
<P>The problem I am facing is that the Preferences dialog is brought up after a reset. This, for most devices, is ok. Unfortunately my device forgets its digitizer settings so that I am unable to do anything on the Preferences screen.
<P>This is a braindead design on an otherwise quite cool device. "Hmmm ... let's NOT calibrate the digitizer before presenting any options to the user ..."
<P>The only way to get a chance to recalibrate the digitizer is by doing a Hard Reset - wiping all programs, settings and data from the device. Not a usable solution.
<P>Enter <I>Recal</I>. <I>Recal</I> will, when the device is reset, wait 5 (or so) seconds and then launch the digitizer calibration program before the Preferences screen is shown.

<P>Changelog:
<PRE>
v2.8 (2006-09-01)
	Fixed a bug where Recal would crash on OS3.0/OS3.1 devices when auto-
	recalibrating.   This will, however, re-introduce the display light-up
	removed in v2.5 ... hmmm - you can't win 'em all!

v2.7 (2006-08-28)
	Removed the dependency on OS3.5. Recal now runs on Palm OS 3.0 and
	better.

v2.6 (2006-07-17)
	Fixed a bug where, if you went through 5 digitizing attempt, Recal may
	restore invalid digitizer settings. If any previous setting had been
	made they're used instead.
	Hard keys now exits the Digitizer screen.
	Timeout on digitizer screen - if no taps are detected within a
	configurable amount the Digitizer screen will exit.
	5 Way support.
	The precision can now be configured.

v2.5 (2006-01-15)
	Enlarged the Recalibrate button.
	Changed versioning from v2rX to v2.X.
	Added better icons.
	Added support for Hi-Density screens.
	AutoDigi is now a procedure alarm - the display on certain models
	shouldn't light up when auto calibrating the display!

v2r4 (2005-09-14)
	When using AutoDigi, do not turn on display on earlier devices when
	doing calibration.

v2r3 (2005-08-21)
	Recal now works on OS3 devices as well. On these devices you'd get a
	FatalError exception due to a use of a system routine not available on
	these devices.

v2r2 (2005-08-12)
	Added a "handbrake" so that the digitizer screen won't loop forever -
	after 5 attempts it will abort.

v2r1 (2005-07-03)
	AutoDigi, notifications prefs, own digitizer etc. etc. - this is
	Recal-1r4 reworked!

v1r4 (2005-03-22)
	Fixed a bug with notifications introduced in 1r3 - recal now actually
	honours the Notifications setting.

v1r3 (2005-03-19)
	Support for notifications.
	Changed home to http://www.schau.com/p/recal/index.html

v1r2 (2003-12-27)
	Up/Down buttons acts as Yes/No on the calibrate screen.
	Delay before popping up the recalibration screen can be changed.

v1r1 (2002-09-13)
	Initial release.
