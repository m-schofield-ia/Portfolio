TTTXExportGUI
-------------


TTTXExportGUI is a simple wrapper around tttxexport.  Using TTTXExportGUI you
can (most of the time) forget about the command line.
You need to have at least tttxexport.exe v1r3 installed for TTTXExportGUI to
work.

A short description of the 5 fields:

TTTXExport
	The full path to tttxexport.exe.  This will normally be set to the
	latest installed version of tttxexport.exe.   Hit the Browse button
	next to the field to locate a different version of tttxexport.exe.

Options
	Extra options to tttxexport.exe.   If you add a -o file switch the
	content of the Output field will be ignored.   See the manual for
	tttxexport for switches.

Output
	Where to store the exported archive.   This is the path to a directory.
	Hit the Browse button next to the field to locate a suitable directory.

Archive
	Which archive to export.   This is stored in:

	\Program Files\Palm\{HotSyncID}\Backup

	The \Program Files\Palm part of the path is the same path you gave
	when installing Palm Desktop.   The {HotSyncID} part is your HotSync
	name.
	The archive is TTTX_{name}.pdb.   The TTTX_atTracker_Data.PDB is not
	a atTracker archive and thus cannot be exported.

Format
	Export archive to format.   See the manual page for tttxexport.exe for
	more informations.


When satisfied click Export to export the archive.
