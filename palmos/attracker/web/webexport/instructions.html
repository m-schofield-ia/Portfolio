<H1>@Tracker - Web Export Instructions</H1>
<P>To use the @Tracker Web Export tool you must have a @Tracker archive at hand. Instructions on how to create a archive is documented in the <A HREF="/gz/palm/attracker/manual/manual.html">@Tracker User Manual</A>. HotSync the archives to your desktop computer and then follow these steps:
<OL>
<LI>Click the <B>Browse</B> button and locate the archive file. The file will be stored in the backup folder in your HotSync hierarchy. The archive file will be named as <I>TTTX_{archive name}.pdb</I>.
<LI>Select the desired date and time formats. This can be set to match the setting on your handheld.
<LI>Select the Linefeed type. Depending on your CSV reader/Operating System it may matter what kind of Linefeeds you use.
<LI>Select the output format - should your archive file be exported to Excel CSV, Standard CSV, PHP or debug formats?
<LI>Leave the <B>Keep Whitespaces</B> checkbox unchecked if you want to have white spaces characters such as tabulators converted to a space.
<LI>When satisfied with your settings click on the <B>Export</B> button and your file will be uploaded, exported and offered as a download.
</OL>
<P>The @Tracker Web Export tool has been tested using Mozilla Firefox. It should work using other browsers. If not, I would like to <A HREF="mailto:brian@schau.com?Subject=[atTracker Web Export] Hmmm ... I wonder why ...">hear from you</A>.
