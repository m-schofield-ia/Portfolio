Secure It
---------


Secure It comes as is - if it breaks you get to keep both pieces.   Secure It
is free to use.    I would like if you would register your copy - see URL
below.



To install Secure It:

1) Start the standard Palm Install tool.
2) Select 'Add'.
3) Browse to 'sit.prc'.  Highlight 'sit.prc' and press 'open'.
4) Make sure that the Hotsync Manager is running.
5) Insert your Palm in the Craddle and start Hotsync.
