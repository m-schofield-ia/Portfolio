Secure It
=========

Extra for v2r6:

The preferences structure used internal have been reorganized.  This will
most likely destroy your current settings.  Please check the Options->Visual
and Options->Security settings when starting v2r6 for the first time!


Important notice if you are upgrading to v2r5 or later:

Please backup your databases before running Secure It v2rX (X>=5).  In v2r5
the Creator ID and Database Type changed.   Under normal conditions you
shouldn't notice anything (except that Secure It Secrets and Secure It
Templates has vanished from the info menu in Launcher :)    But better be
safe than sorry ...


Important notice if you are upgrading from any previous version:

The database format has changed dramatically between v1 and v2 of Secure It.
When Secure It v2rX starts for the first time it will, if a database in the
new format is not found, try to open any older version of the database and
convert it to the new format.   Depending of the size of your database this
might take some time.
The new database is named 'Secure It Secrets'.   This database can coexist
with the older 'secureit-db'.   If you feel happy about how Secure It v2rX
works feel free to delete the 'secureit-db' database.
Please also note that the 'Secure It Templates' database is used to hold your
templates - it should be backed up also.



Legal Stuff:

Secure It comes as is - if it breaks you get to keep both pieces.   Secure It
is free to use. 



To install Secure It:

1) Start the standard Palm Install tool.
2) Select 'Add'.
3) Browse to 'sit.prc'.  Highlight 'sit.prc' and press 'open'.
4) Make sure that the Hotsync Manager is running.
5) Insert your Palm in the Craddle and start Hotsync.
