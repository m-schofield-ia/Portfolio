<P><BR>
<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P><B>Kasino</B> is a Scorecard for the card game of Kasino as it is played in Denmark. The game is a simple but amusing cardgame for 2 to 4 players each trying to sweep as many card from the table as possible to get the most points. Kasino helps you track the scores. Furthermore, Kasino can be set to notify the players of the end of the game after a certain amount of rounds or when one or more of the players reaches a pre-determined score.

<H3>Installation</H3>
