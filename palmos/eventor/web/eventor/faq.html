<DL>
<DT>Is Eventor really free?</DT>
<DD>Yes. Eventor is free in the sense that you don't have to pay me any money at all.
<DT>So, what license comes with Eventor?</DT>
<DD>Short answer: none. It comes as-is. &nbsp; Long answer: It comes as-is. If it breaks you get to keep both pieces. Ok? The license is based on GNU GPL v2.</DD>
<DT>Is the source code for Eventor available?</DT>
<DD>Depends. I have not uploaded the source code for public inspection. It is available on request.</DD>
<DT>What about a desktop version of Eventor?</DT>
<DD>It is on my Todo-list. But it has been down-prioritized at the moment ... I have too many other projects on my hand. And I need to sort out whether I will create it in C++, Java or C#</DD>
<DT>What is this Eventor Conduit I've been hearing so much about?</DT>
<DD>The Eventor Conduit is a dll for Microsoft Windows which gets called as a part of the HotSync synchronization. It downloads data from the Eventor application to your desktop PC.</DD>
<DT>Come on! The backup manager in HotSync takes care of that!</DT>
<DD>Yes - that is absolutely true.</DD>
<DT>Do I need it then?</DT>
<DD>No - not at the moment. But when the Eventor desktop application is a reality you will be needing it. At the moment, I am happy if people downloads and uses the conduit. That way, all bugs will hopefully be squashed when the Eventor desktop application sees the light.</DD>
<DT>Help! I have a lot of events to enter - is there a quick way to do it?</DT>
<DD>Yes. Use Palm OS Emulator to enter your data, then export the database and install it on your handheld. Or, if you have installed the conduit, you can do a bit of <A HREF="dates.html">cheating</A> ...</DD>
<DT>This one from Glen Brooksby - thanks Glen!</DT>
<DD>When selecting the year of an event, if you place your stylus on the forward or backward button for the year and hold the stylus down, the years scroll by very quickly. I found this was perfectly adequate for entering 'old' events. This works on my Handpring Visor Deluxe, Palm OS v3.0.</DD>
