<H1>Eventor User Manual</H1>
<P><BR>
<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>Eventor is a Personal Event Reminder manager. It assists you in remembering all your important personal forthcoming events, such as birthdays, anniversaries and the like. Eventor is not a calender program - use the builtin Datebook for calendering. The builtin Datebook can do what Eventor does - but Eventor does it more intuitively :o)
<P>Some features of Eventor:
<UL>
<LI>Eventor runs on any Palm OS 3.0 or better device - you need Palm OS 4.0 to enjoy some of the more advanced features, though.
<LI>Eventor can notify you of upcoming events with a variable interval and at a specified time of day.
<LI>Eventor is free - that is, you do not have to pay me anything.
</UL>

<H3>Installation</H3>
<P>Installation of Eventor is like installing any other Palm OS program:
<OL>
<LI>Download [<A HREF="#refs">1</A>] Eventor.
<LI>Unpack the <B>eventor.zip</B> archive using WinZip [<A HREF="#refs">3</A>] or UnZip [<A HREF="#refs">4</A>].
<LI>Start the standard Palm Install tool. Select 'Add', then browse to where you unpacked the <B>eventor.zip</B> archive. Highlight the <B>eventor.prc</B> file and select 'Open'. Then select 'Done'.
<LI>Start the HotSync Manager if it is not running.
<LI>Insert your Palm PDA in the craddle, then press the HotSync button on the craddle.
</OL>
<P>When the synchronization is done you will have a 'Eventor' icon in the <I>Unfiled</I> category on your Palm PDA. Feel free to move Eventor to another category.
<P>If you use Microsoft Windows 95 or better you might want to install the Eventor Conduit as well:
<OL>
<LI>Download [<A HREF="#refs">2</A>] the Eventor Conduit.
<LI>Double click the <B>.exe</B> file and follow the instructions.
</OL>

<H3>Using Eventor</H3>
<P><IMG SRC="gfx/eventor.gif" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="160" ALT="Main Screen"> On the main screen all registered events are shown. Tap on the name of an event to view the event and details of this event. Tap <I>New</I> to add an event. Tap <I>Next</I> to show details of the next forthcoming event. The <I>Print</I> button will only be shown if you have <A HREF="http://www.stevenscreek.com/palm/palmprint.shtml">Palm Print</A> installed. Tap the button to get a printout of all events. This have been tested on my Tungsten|T using a bluetooth connection to a <A HREF="http://www.mpitech.com/bpa/">MPI bluetooth printer adapter</A> driving an Epson Stylus Color 640 printer.

<P><BR><IMG SRC="gfx/viewevent.gif" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="160" ALT="View Event"> Tapping an event on the main screen brings up the View Event dialog with details about the event. Tap <I>Done</I> to return to the main screen. Tap <I>Edit</I> to edit the details of the event. Tap <I>Delete</I> to delete the event - you will be asked to confirm your action. The number in parenthesis after the date is the <B>age</B> of the event. This is the number of years passed since the first time this event occured. F.ex. for a persons birthday the <B>age</B> would be the age of the person.

<P><BR><IMG SRC="gfx/newevent.gif" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="160" ALT="New/Edit Event"> Tapping <I>New</I> on the main screen or <I>Edit</I> on the View Event dialog brings up the Edit Event dialog. If this is a new event all fields are empty.
Enter a short description of the event in the <B>Event</B> field. Set the date of the event by tapping the <B>Not Set</B> button. If you want to be reminded of the event, check the <B>Remind me</B> checkbox. Enter the number of days you want to be reminded before the event is due in the <B>day(s) before event</B> field. If you want to be reminded everyday from the <B>day(s) before event</B> date to the day the event is due, check the <B>Repeat every day to event</B> checkbox.
You can place the event in a category by selecting the category in the upper right corner of the screen.
Tap <I>OK</I> to add the event, <I>Cancel</I> to discard the event and return to the main screen.

<P><BR><IMG SRC="gfx/example.gif" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="160" ALT="Example">Example. I want to add my own birthday, I want to be reminded 5 days before and everyday there after until the event is due. My birthday is 12th of June, 1971. So I set the category to the builtin <B>Birthday</B> category enter a description ("My own birthday") in the <B>Event</B> field. The date is set to <B>6-12-1971</B> (American notation). I check the <B>Remind me</B> checkbox. I wanted to be reminded 5 days before the event (<B>day(s) before event</B>) and everyday there after (<B>Repeat every day to event</B>).
<P>The date notation used on this dialog and the main screen is based upon your preferences.

<P><BR><IMG SRC="gfx/menu.gif" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="160" ALT="Menus"> If you bring up the menu on the main screen you have the following options:
<UL>
<LI><B>Notifications</B> - view forthcoming notifications (in case you missed them earlier today!)
<LI><B>Preferences</B> - here you can change the behaviour of Eventor.
<LI><B>About</B> - a simple about screen giving details about where to find Eventor etc.
</UL>

<P><BR><IMG SRC="gfx/notifications.gif" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="160" ALT="Notifications"> If you select the <B>Notifications</B> menu item you will be given a list of forthcoming events. Use the little arrows in the lower right corner (not shown) to show the next/previous event. This dialog is also brought up once a day if there are any pending events. So you do not need to launch Eventor to see forthcoming events. Tap <B>Done</B> to dismiss the dialog.

<P><BR><IMG SRC="gfx/preferences.gif" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="160" ALT="Preferences"> Select <B>Preferences</B> from the main menu to change the behaviour of Eventor. Eventor brings up the Notifications dialog at the time specified in <B>Alarm at</B>. Default is to bring up the dialog at midnight. Check the <B>Sound alarm</B> box to have Eventor play a sound when the Event list is shown. The sound is only played at the time specified in the <B>Alarm at</B> box. Check the <B>Show notifications on power up</B> box to show the Event list each turn you turn on your PDA. This requries Palm OS 4.0 or better, though. Tap <B>OK</B> to save the new preferences, <B>Cancel</B> to discard changes.
<P><BR><P><BR>That is all there is to it. Enjoy! :o)
