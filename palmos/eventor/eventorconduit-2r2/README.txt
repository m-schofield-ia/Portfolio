Legal Stuff:

What does it do?

The conduit is called by the HotSync manager when data from the Eventor
application on your handheld needs to be synchronized with your desktop PC.
The data will be written in a human readable/-changeble form.   One day ...
a desktop version of Eventor may surface.  You do the math!  :o)
