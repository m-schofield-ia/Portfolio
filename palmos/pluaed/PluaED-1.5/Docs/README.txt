PluaED
======

PluaED is a simple editor which can be used to edit Plua source files.  Plua
can read source files in DOC format or from Memo Pad.  DOC writers usually
costs money, Memo Pad can only edit source files up to 4096 characters.
PluaED overcomes some of these limitations - PluaED is free and can edit
source files up to 65534 characters (if your device supports it).
PluaED uses the Memo Pad database to store it's source file.  If you view a
source file created by PluaED in Memo Pad the source file may be truncated -
source files created by PluaED is easy recognisable as they start with '--'
and ends in '.lua'.

PluaED supports both Plua version 1 as well as Plua version 2.
