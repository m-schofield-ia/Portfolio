<H1>HSNSwitch v1.5</H1>
<P><IMG SRC="hsnswitch.gif" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="160" ALT="HSNSwitch"><I>HSNSwitch</I> can be used to change your HotSync name on the fly. I got a new Palm and made it my primary PDA. It inherited the old HotSync name so that I could continue using most of the software I use without a change. I also decided that my old Palm (a Tungsten T) was going to be a replacement for my Gameboy (yes - the original b/w one :-) So I had to find a way to move the games registered for primary Palm to the game-device.
<P>Enter <I>HSNSwitch</I>. Basically, <I>HSNSwitch</I> can change the HotSync name on the fly - that is, before a program/game is launched the name is changed and after the application exits the name is reset.
<P><I>HSNSwitch</I> (currently) runs on PalmOS 5.x (and 5.x only!).
<P><I>HSNSwitch</I> is released under the GNU General Public License v2.
