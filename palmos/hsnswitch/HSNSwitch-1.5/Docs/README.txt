HSNSwitch
=========


When adding a new PDA to your collection you might face the dilemma of having
some application which is not able to run on the new device due to license
obstacles.
I retired my Tungsten T when I got a new one.  The new PDA inherited the
HotSync name as it was my primary PDA.   My Tungsten T was going to be a
replacement for my Gameboy - it would need a new HotSync name.
Unfortunately, by changing the HotSync name all the games I've bought wouldn't
run in full mode as their license was bound to the old HotSync name.
Enter HSNSwitch.   HSNSwitch will dynamically change the HotSync name when
launching a program and reset the HotSync name to the previous name.
HSNSwitch (currently) runs on PalmOS 5.x (and 5.x only!)
HSNSwitch is released under the GNU General Public License v2.

HSNSwitch and User Manual can be found at:

Caution! HSNSwitch was developed for OS 5.0. It works nicely on my Tungsten T.
HSNSwitch has been tested on the OS Simulator v5.1 - v5.4 and it worked in
this controlled environment.  However, one thing is a simulator another thing
is real life.   Please, please, please - do a _full_ backup before using
HSNSwitch.
If HSNSwitch gets something wrong it might mess up your HotSync record on the
handheld.   Normally, only a full (=hard) reset can rectify this ...

Also, please, please, please - read the manual at the website mentioned above.


Thank you for taking the time to evaluate HSNSwitch.
