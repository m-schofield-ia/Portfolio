These are the things which would be nice to have in Griddler:

* A solver.  There exists numerous algorithm on the net.  I need to find the
  time to download and understand one of these  :-)

* Puzzle entry.   Should be easy to do.  Ask for sizes and then present 'sizes' 
  text entry fields where one can enter the clues.   The entered puzzles should
  be stored in a database.

* Beaming - both databases and individual puzzles should be beamable.

* Better icons. Yes, I suck at drawing icons!
