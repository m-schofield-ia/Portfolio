<H1>MathAce - testimonials</H1>
<P>These testimonials was collected by Ron Lampe from Creswell, Oregon. Ron's words:
<I>Thanks again for updating Math Ace to 1.6. I absolutely love it and so do my students. We have been recording our data for the first four weeks of school and decided I wanted to have their input. I had them write about Math Ace on their keyboards and beam it to me. I teach math for 6-8 grade. Obviously I did not edit their comments, but some are actually pretty funny.</I>
<P>Yes, they're actually quite funny - they're presented as unedited as possible:

<P>I think math ace helped us because it gets us warmed up for the day. It also gets us sometimes better. At the start of the year I wasn't doing to good but now I am.  
<BR>    -- Aaron, 6th grade

<P>I think Math Ace is really awesome because it has really helped me improve with math and know right away what the anwser is and not have to look up at the multiplication chart or have to think about each problem for like a minute which will never help you when you take this quiz.
<BR>    -- Adriana, 7th grade 

<P>mathace helps me understand math better I can do it faster than I could when we started Math Ace
<BR>    -- Aj, 7th grade

<P>I like math ace because it helps me with math and improves my grade. It is also kind of fun. Acordding to my opinion at least. I think it is also kind of interesting how it times you. But then again it is electronic so it can. Thats what I think about Math Ace.

<BR>    -- Ariana, 6th grade

<P>I like math sometimes. Because sometimes it wont work with the number 5 and that takes about 10 seconds off my time. I guess I've improved a little.
<BR>I think it's better than paper-pencil though. 
<BR>    -- Austin, 6th grade

<P>I like math ace because we start on our own and don't have to wait for every one. We just get our palms and start on our math.

<P>Math Ace has helped me in my mutipluction and divion probles. At first I was a little scerred to be in general math, but now I'm doing lot's better than I use to, from 25 to 72 problems in 5 minutes. I thing that's an improvement.
<BR>    -- Dakota, 6th grade

<P>I think that math ace is better because it has a timer. A timer is better because you get 5 minutes. In math ace you get to see your score. When you get to see your score you know how to improve your score. If you forget your score you can see your score and wright your score down.

<BR>    -- Justin, 7th grade

<P>The thing about matheace is an easy subject, becuase it helps you get faster at typing faster with your hands moving every where and it helps you with math to get better at it and the thing about it is you have 5 minutes and you have to learn how to do math faster and faster and even more faster but as i was saying you have 5 minutes to complete and it has your name and your score on the award sympothy, its really fun, because you get to play mathace and get faster and better at it cause you have all year to use lab top and palm pilots and it gets to be hard at times as i ws saying and still getting there. its easy but i have to go ....................

I have improved so much. I went from 61/65 now its 96/96. Knowing that you probably put a lot of time to make this for a bunch of kids is very cool, and I love this program. To be honest, When Mr.Lampe said we had a new program, I thought it would be boring, but after I played it I loved it. I think that you are a very good person for doing this for all of us. That was the best thing anybody could do. THANK YOU!!!!!!!!
