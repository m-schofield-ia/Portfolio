<H1>PowerPlay User Manual</H1>
<P><BR>
<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>An exponent is a number placed to the upper right of a base number. It shows the number of times the base number is multiplied by itself.
<P>Examples:
<UL>
<LI>3 ^ 2 = 3 x 3 = 9
<LI>5 ^ 4 = 5 x 5 x 5 x 5 = 624
<LI>8 ^ 6 = 8 x 8 x 8 x 8 x 8 x 8 = 262,144
</UL>
<P>PowerPlay is a game where you guess missing bases or exponents in equations. You score fewer points the closer your guess is to the actual number that completes each equation.
<P>After 10 rounds, you are given a final score. Lower scores are better. The top 5 scores are recorded on the Leader Board for each level of play.

<P>There are two levels, easy and hard. In each level you can select to guess the base or the exponent.
<P><I>Easy</I> games use bases between <B>2-8</B> and <B>10</B>. <I>Easy</I> games use exponents between <B>2</B> and <B>6</B>.
<P><I>Hard</I> games use bases between <B>4-9</B>, <B>11</B> and <B>12</B>. <I>Hard</I> games uses exponents between <B>5</B> and <B>12</B>.
