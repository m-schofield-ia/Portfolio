<H3>Manual</H3>
<P>Install iSecurViewer by running the application and click <B>Next</B> a couple of times and then <B>Finish</B>. You will now have a iSecurViewer group in your start menu. Launch iSecurViewer. If you get some messages saying something about <I>debug</I> then you need to have Microsoft .NET framework v2.0 installed - please do so using the link above or by going to Windows Update.
<P><IMG SRC="selectprofile.jpg" WIDTH="255" HEIGHT="149" ALT="Select Profile">When launched for the first time iSecurViewer prompts you to select your HotSync Profile. You need to have transferred the iSecur database before you can view it - this step will auto located it given your profile. The profile can be changed from the main menu. If you hit <B>Cancel</B> you will get a standard file requestor and you can then browse to the iSecur database file if it is placed in a non standard path.

<P><BR><P><IMG SRC="password.jpg" WIDTH="298" HEIGHT="201" ALT="Enter Password">Enter the password to unlock the database. If you have previously set a Password Hint for the database you can recall that by pressing the <B>Hint</B> button.

<P><BR><P><IMG SRC="main.jpg" WIDTH="544" HEIGHT="407" ALT="Main">On the main screen all your secrets are listed. Use the various filters to locate the entry to be shown and then double click the entry.

<P><BR><P><IMG SRC="show.jpg" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="250" ALT="Show">Click <B>OK</B> to dismiss the entry and go back to the main form.

<H3>Note</H3>
<P>iSecurViewer may some day evolve to a <I>real</I> product. Currently it is made as a functioning proof of concept. It is somewhat insecure as it cannot guarantee the encryptedness of data swapped/paged to disk. This means that if someone steals your computer the bad guy <B>_may_</B> be able to see some of the data in plaintext.
<P>You have been warned.
