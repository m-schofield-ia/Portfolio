Hi Brian,
Thanks for your ultra fast response...
Ok, here's what happens.  When I first launch iSecur-1.6 it prompts:-
The iSecure database was not found so a new database will be created....etc,
tap next.
Tap and drag your stylus...etc,
Next screen says Enter new password,
if I use the password generator or make up my own and confirm my E hangs and
requires a reset.
Thanks
JC
