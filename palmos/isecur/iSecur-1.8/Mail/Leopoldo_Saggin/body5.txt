Dear Brian,
this is the second example concerning an incorrect screen management.
Herein enclosed you find 3 different jpg.
The first one (3.jpg) show the initial situation.
I am in the "Select Template" (=Scelta Modello) situation.
The second one (4.jpg") shows what happens if I choose a template which fill-in all the screen. The button on the right bottom which generates a password is partially covered.
If, however I click on this button and then I cancel the operation of the generation of the password the screen comes ok (5.jpg)
