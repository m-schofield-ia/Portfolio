Dear Brian,
I tried to install your Italian 1.7 version both in the Palm simulator and Palm Emulator. In both cases there were some errors which crashed both Simulator and Emulator.
In one case (Emulator) as soon as I arrived to try to finish to tap on the screen to generate the random seed to cryptate the database, a window appeared telling me that "Isecur read from a location memory 0x00033AA8 which is an unallocated chunck of mermory" and crashedd POSE.
This happened 3 times.

On the contrary Simulator, after an initial crash while inputting the password, seems to work.

Anyway I found a couple of bugs in the refresh of the screen you probably didn't see because the English/Danish strings are too short to make them evident.
I did not explain them now because I have no time and I would make the most of my corrections before to re-sumbit my translation to you togheter with the above considerations on the refresh of the screen (maybe I submit the snapshot of them).
Moreover I think that if the author of icons changed (Ignacio Sueiras) this should also be reported in the info. Am I wrong?
I hope I can resubmit my transaltion in few days.
