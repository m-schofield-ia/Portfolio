Well the situation was this. I tried to import from my PalmOne Backup (on C:\Programs\Palmone\Username\backup) the file iSec_iSecur_Data.pdb
to my Palm Simulator where iSecure 1.7 is running.

I dragged & dropped the file and a window whose title was
"Can't  import record" warned me:
"Skipped record 177 while importing C:\programs....\isec_iSecur_Data.pdb
I clicked the "Ok"  butto on this window ant the message was repeted for about 10 times (record number 177 and following).
I have about 180 records, so it seems like the last records were skipped. But I did not find apparently none lacking.
