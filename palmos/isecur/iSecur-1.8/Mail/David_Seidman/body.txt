> I loaded iSecur onto a Handspring Visor, Palm OS v. 3.5.2H3.0.  I opened
the program, then closed it and ran your database converter program.  (I've
been happily using Securit for several years.)  I opened iSecur again and
selected Preferences from the menu.  That resulted in a Fatal Alert: form.c,
Line1728, Object not in form.  This happened each time I tried it.
