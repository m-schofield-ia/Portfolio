Dear Brian:
I didn't receive any answer from you so I'm not sure you get the message I sent on Aug, 9th. I'm sending it again. Please let me know if you got it.

Dear Brian:
I am enclosing the first draft of the Spanish translation. Give it a look and tell me what I missed.
Please note that I translated the Hot Letters in the menues like in the following example to match the Hot Letters in the Spanish translation of Palm OS.
Original:
       MENUITEM "Undo" ID 10000 "U"
       MENUITEM "Cut" ID 10001 "X"
       MENUITEM "Copy" ID 10002 "C"
       MENUITEM "Paste" ID 10003 "P"
       MENUITEM "Select All" ID 10004 "S"
       MENUITEM SEPARATOR
       MENUITEM "Keyboard" ID 10006 "K"
       MENUITEM "Graffiti" ID 10007 "G"
Translated:
       MENUITEM "Deshacer" ID 10000 "Z"
       MENUITEM "Cortar" ID 10001 "X"
       MENUITEM "Copiar" ID 10002 "C"
       MENUITEM "Pegar" ID 10003 "V"
       MENUITEM "Seleccionar Todo" ID 10004 "E"
       MENUITEM SEPARATOR
       MENUITEM "Teclado" ID 10006 "T"
       MENUITEM "Ayuda de Graffiti" ID 10007 "G"

Also, I would like to include my own credits in the translated version. If you agree, please insert the following sentence:
"Traducido al castellano por Carlos Corso - Argentina"

Hope to hear from you
Regards,
Carlos

 Dear Brian:
It was a pleasure to work on the translation. It's my way to thank you for your effort producing and giving iSecur for free.
If you ever think visiting Argentina, please let me know.
If you want to see some pics of me and family, take a look at http://carlos.karina.fotopic.net
Have a nice day.
Carlos

 Hi Brian:
I'm not a developer. I'm an ophthalmologist but I've been helping to translate some Palm and PC software. All of them have been freeware o software with some social benefit purposes. This is my way as a user to say thank you to all the people that believe in freeware or social oriented projects.
I can find for you some ophthalmologists here but will be unable to find software developers :-D !
What about you? I visited your webpage and found you are from Denmark, aren't you? What do yo do for living? Of course, you are released to answer any of these questions. I was just curious as I found the net as a wonderful place to meet people and know about the world.
Regards,
Carlos
