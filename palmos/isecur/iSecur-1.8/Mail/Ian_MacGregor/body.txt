Hi, my name is Ian MacGregor and I just downloaded and installed iSecur http://www.schau.com/gz/palm/isecur/index.html

I wanted to let you know how your software works on newer PDA's. I am using a Palm T|X (Palm OS Garnet 5.4) and iSecur works flawlessly. Thank you for writing this much-needed program for PDA users :)

Sincerely,
Ian MacGregor
