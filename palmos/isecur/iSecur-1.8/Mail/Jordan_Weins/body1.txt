I finally noticed that the "new" secure it was out!  I'm such a slacker.  Anyway, thanks for the much needed update.

One minor bug so far:

I can usually cause iSecur to reset by double-tapping on the blank "icon" space (where you click once to change the icon for an entry) under edit mode.  Not 100%, but it usually only takes a couple of tries.

This is on a treo 650.

Also, if I wanted to create my own icons to contribute to the project, what's the best way/format to do that in?
