Great freeware.
I was looking quite long for something like this. I have tried also 
commercial software but it is unnecesserily comprehensive. On the other 
hand, other freeware (YAPS, Keyring) are too simple and not Treo 5nav 
compatible. Your iSecur is the right choice in the middle.

Some ideas:
1. Use more the built in password generator, e.g. if in the template is 
something like [password], pwd generator icon will be displayed and generated password 
will be automatically inserted in this field
2. On initial screen, optíon for displaying numerical keyboard for quick 
PIN entry.

Something like this


Regards
