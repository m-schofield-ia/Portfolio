I enjoy your program iSecur.  Good work.

I do have one problem.

Occassionally, am working on an existing Secret, the entire secret is entirely lost when

1) Iam in updating a Secret

2) iSecur exit out either by system timeout or I manually turn off the Palm.

I could understand if it was a New Secret and I didn't hit ok.

But why would I previous data entirely when I working on an existing Secret.

The strange part is that I cannot recreate this scenario consistently, thus I can figure out what exactly I do that causes this.

Thank you.

Thanks for replying Brian,

1) Yes, the Secret is completely gone from my Palm Tx.  They cannot be
located in any category (ALL, Unfiled, etc)

2) Palm Tx (OS 5?),  Im not astute as to identifying patches and updates,
but I do have wide eclectic array of programs loaded into the Palm.

I try to be more aware when Im in iSecur and hope to discover a pattern.
Thanks.

Hi Allan,


I've tried to reproduce what you describe - without success.   I cannot
get iSecur to lose a secret.   So:

1) What do you mean by "Entirely lost" - is the secret no longer present
when you re-enter iSecur?      Have you looked in another category?
Is the filter in the lower right corner set to "All"?

2) I know you can't recreate it - but at least you can tell me what kind of
device(s) are you using and what version of the Palm OS are you running
(incl. patches/updates).
