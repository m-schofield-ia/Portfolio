command bar) when entering data after loading a template. Is that
intentional?--Regards,Dmitry




> Hi Brian,Indeed! I should have tried that before emailing to you. :)One
more minor issue I&#39;ve noticed so far is that you
need&nbsp;to&nbsp;&quot;accept&nbsp;input&quot;&nbsp;twice&nbsp;when&nbsp;enterring&nbsp;master&nbsp;password&nbsp;with&nbsp;on-screen&nbsp;keyboard.

you need to hit Ok button on login form.Is it possible to implement a
&quot;single tap login solution&quot; when using on-screen keyboard?
