 Brian,
I was just writing this e-mail when I received your last message:

Rules!!!

Everything went OK and now I'm a proud user of iSecur. Thanks a lot!.

Where in Denmark do you live?. I've been in Nordborg and Kolding one
year ago for a Danfoss training course: I do really enjoyed the visit
very much and your country is really beautiful (and food is really good
too... oh my god!, I came back to Spain with 3 more kg in my body!;
lovely breakfasts (what a nice different kinds of bread you have!) ;-)
Have you ever been at Danfoss Universe
(http://www.danfoss-teknorama.com/)? (Danfoss took us there and I had a
very enjoyable time with colleges from all over the world).

Thanks again for your program, your time, your fast response and your
kindness.

Ignacio

BTW: Would you like to translate iSecur into Spanish?. I will be glad to
translate current version and maintain upgrades of the program with a
good and "academic" translation. Just tell how and I will be happy to do
it. I offer my lovely T|X for betatesting too ;-).
BTW2: I can see that you have good programming skills and that you like
Palm... Do you admit ideas for software development?.

Hey,

Try the attached version. The version previously downloadable from
my website was a debug version.
I fixed that - it should work now ...

BTW, did you know that your employer originates from Denmark where
I live? :-)
