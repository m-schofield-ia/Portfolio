Hi Brian,
Just a couple of lines to tell you that although I do not write you emails "asking for palm soft" or contributing to the soft idea we have in mind, I am still alive (although travelling a lot al over Spain...) and working on my part (looking for icons and so...).

I have just downloaded iSecureViewer-1.5; ¿do you plan to make an editable version?, if only I had a little time... my C++ Qt win/Linux programming days are not so far for me to have forgotten everything and I could make that program and the conduit... Let's cross fingers and see if I find the time to keep on developing... (if you like it, of course).

On the other hand... I do have the time to make translations... If you like iSecure to be translated, just send me a file with the works/phrases and I will do my best.

Regards,
Ignacio

BTW: A college from Danfoss told me that "real cold have just arrived..." on that lands... Take care and enjoy the snow for me  :-)

Subject: iSecur-1.4 & iSecurViewer-1.5 released!

Hello,


I just wanted to tell you that iSecur-1.4 and iSecurViewer-1.5 is
out!


Highlights of iSecur-1.4:

* When doing a find inside iSecur the entire secret is searched.
* Fixed a bug where the Quick Find on the main list would bomb if a
   secret was added and then immediately was deleted.
* Preferences item added: if you add a new secret or edit an existing
   secret and you change the category you now have the option to stay in
   the category you're coming from.
* Preferences item added: if you load a template you have the option to
   store the secret in the same category as the template.
* The function of the 5 way up/down can now be changed so that up/down
   on a focused list without any selections is page up/down. Normal GUI
   guidelines states that 5 way up/down should move between GUI elements
   much like 5 way left/right does.
* Fixed some 5 way navigator related bugs.
* When you load a template into a secret which already contains some
   text you can now add to the secret instead of replacing the original
   text.
* The Password Generator Icon should now come up with the right image
   all the time.
* You can now set a hint about your password. The hint can be brought up
   on the "Enter password" dialog.
* Double clicking on the "Select Icon" icon on the edit screen no longer
   crashes iSecur.
* iSecur installs itself into the "Main" category of your launcher by
   default (if such a category exists).
* Import from Memo/Export to Memo implemented.
* Text can now be copied from the secret to clipboard in Show mode.

Kind regards,
