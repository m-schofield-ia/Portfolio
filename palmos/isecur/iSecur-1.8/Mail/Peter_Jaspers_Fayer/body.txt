You're welcome.  I've been using Secure-IT for years, and when I looked
it up to show them where to download it, I was surprised to find iSecure,
and saw the PayPal link.

I am happy to report that the migration to iSecure was seamless
(I guess I could have used export from SecureIT and import to iSecure,
but your program made it dead easy!)

Now if I could only come to some better way of organizing and filing
all the stuff in there to make things easy to find, things would be
perfect. (My own fault).

Only it would be nice if the "up/down" rocker would move up and down
the list. (I have a Treo 650).  As well, if I type 2 or more letters
within less than (say) two seconds, it would be nice if it would then
jump down to entries starting with those letters. (it works for one
now ). This seems to be the way "one-handed" lookups are going.
