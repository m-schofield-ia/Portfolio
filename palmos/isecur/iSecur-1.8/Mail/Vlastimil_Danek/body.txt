Brian,
first thank You for excelent SecureIt and Isecur SW.

My english is bad, maybe I write all correct ...
I have 2 please:
1) I have IconDB with 221 Icons. Isecur show only first 216 icons (27*8).
When i add to my Icon set next 3 (to be 224 - (28*80), Isecur stay show only
216. I must create Icon set with 225 icons, to show my 224 icons.

2) I use DateBk. In this Icons is show as group of 1-13 in first collum,
14-.. in next... Maybe if I remember OK, Agendust show icons as well,
IconMgr too. Isecur show icons in rows, not in collums. Is possible change
or set to select this order ? Is possible skip in icon view not as rows, but
as pages ?

Thanks for Your time, Happy new Year to Your and all your friends ...
