Hi,

Firstly just realised when I copied part of your original email I left the
Hi to myself - obviously got a little confused there.

Regarding the bug that I was experiencing I believe I have found when it
happens and how to duplicate it :

> >* (BUG) I've had one report of iSecur deleting a secret when:

How to duplicate it :

1. Open iSecur
2. Switch to 'All' category
3. Edit a record
4. Press palm application home button (ie. exit iSecur)
5. On return the record is gone

On a further note, apologies for being a pain on the topic of quickfind.
I think this might relate to the "!!! DONE !!! * (BUG) Minor bugs with positioning
in quickfind.". 

Steps
1. Open isecur
2. Press a letter for quickfind
3. Press down on 5 way navigation key
4. Record at top of displayed list is correctly highlighted
5. Press another letter for quickfind
6. Press down on 5 way navigation key
7. Record after last quickfind is highlighted instead of top of currently
displayed list
8. Move focus to category selection
9. Press a letter for quickfind
10. Press down on 5 way navigation key
11. Record at top of displayed list is correctly highlighted
12. Open any record
13. Return to list of records

Follow the above steps again and the correct highlighting no longer occurs
after a quickfind.

Thanks again.

Anthony.
