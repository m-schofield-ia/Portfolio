Hi,

Thanks for the continued work as always. I thought I would inform you of
some things on the Treo 650.

- The annoying bug that deletes a record on exit seems to be partly fixed.
ie. when exit it does not delete the record (GOOD) but on return into 'isecur'
it is in edit mode on a different record.
- The 5 way key navigation still does not work when viewing a record (NOT
in edit mode)
- Export/Import is excellent - I like the new apply icon on import.

Regards
Anthony.
