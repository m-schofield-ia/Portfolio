Hi,

Thanks for the quick response.

> What do you mean by a "detailed search"? What kind of search option do
> you need?
- It is great that iSecur is integrated into the global search of the Palm.
What about being able to search through the actual contents of the secrets.
Now I am sure neither of us would want this integrated with the Palm search
but if iSecur had its own internal search then all records and secret could
be searched after the password has been capture. I have been looking around
at a number of other password applications like yours and they all have a
built in search.

- May as well ignore this one I was trying to figure out the quickfind and
did not realise that it could be done while highlighting the category in the
record view screen

I don't understand this one. Please give some examples.

- It may be a Treo only thing which is why I included the diagram of the
Treo. The centre of the phone has a circle that has arrows point
up,down,left,right. This is only a useability thing and does not cause any
problems. When displaying the list of records the only way to move down is
to do so one record at a time. The Treo was designed to function with one
hand only. Thus moving down can be quite tedious if one has 100's of
records. If the down and up arrows of this central button could act as a
page up and page down then this process would be greatly enhanced.




Is there any way to add more icons the ones you have are great but seem to
refer a lot to cars and car parts. It is a bit of a shame to be able to
create a completely blank record with no error.

Another useability thing - if you create a new record in a category 'x' and
then press OK when you return to the list of records view it shows you
category 'x' from the new record instead of returning you to the view you
were last in.

Thanks for your response. I am keen to continue using iSecur and pay for it
once it stops resetting my phone. Good luck with your TODO list.

Regards
Anthony.
