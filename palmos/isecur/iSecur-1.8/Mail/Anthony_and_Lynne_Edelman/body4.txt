HI,

The navigation issue is on the "show secret form" - it works fine on the edit secret form.

The bulk change for the icon during import is a great place to do that.

I dont have any hacks or utilities that would collide - That I know of, I have not installed any. If you want me to run some test code I will do that with pleasure. I can only imagine how frustrating I have been there before myself. Do you want step by step screen shots or something as I do the actions.

Thanks about the quickfind - again can try send screen shots (will do with a camera). Thought you might have run out of steam on that one.

Thanks again
Anthony.
