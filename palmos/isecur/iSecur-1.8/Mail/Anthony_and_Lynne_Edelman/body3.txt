Hi,

Thanks for the new version of 'iSecur' I have reverted back to the test version of 1.4 since I cannot navigate buttons during readmode of a record using the 5 way navigation button, I can in the test version. The import/export works well - nice to have it. This feature highlights the need for another feature "To do a bulk action on records ie. Category change, icon allocation" - since imports from memo no icon appears.

Following are the problems that I have found with the newly released version 1.4 :

- Wrong message on succesful export

- The deletion of records in the scenario below still occur
