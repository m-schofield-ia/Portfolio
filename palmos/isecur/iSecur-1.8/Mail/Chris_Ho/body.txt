Hi there,

I've just installed iSecur, and transferred the secrets from Secure It using the sit2secur program.

I'm trying to do import and export of secrets in iSecur, and have checked the documentation.
Seems it does not have any, unlike Secure It.

Unless I'm missing something, can you help me out on this?
Otherwise, iSecur would indeed be a better application and Secure It.

Thanks!

regards,
Chris

Hi Brian,

Thanks for your reply. Glad to know the support for iSecure is indeed great.
I will be looking out for your next versions then.

Thanks, and have a good week ahead.

regards,
Chris
