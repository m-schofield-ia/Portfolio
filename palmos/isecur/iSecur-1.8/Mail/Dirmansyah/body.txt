Subject: [iSecur] Focus, Scroll Hard-buttons, 3 fields in one line
Brian,

1. When we enter the edit form, which field is the
focus? the Title or
the Secret? So that we can write down directly?

2. Using the Scroll hard-button is confusing. First, I
must tap the
secret field. Then, when I push the scroll down
hard-button, it scrolls
once. Pushing the scroll-down HB again, the pointer
move to title field.
Again, it moves to secret field, and so on.


3. If I want to enter the following items, can I use
template?:

   Title: My Title ...(never change)
   Secret:
          ABCD 1257 xyz
          HTYR 8896 tei
          POST 5549 kwl
          etc..

So , each time I enter data, I only need to modify the
secret, not the
title. e.g. ABCD, then 1257, then xyz.

 How to make template for entering "three fields but
make them in one
line and title does not change?" Meaning: only I
record is used


Thanks.
