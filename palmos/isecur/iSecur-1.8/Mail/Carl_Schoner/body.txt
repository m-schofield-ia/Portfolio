Hi Brian,
 
I will check it out and if I have suggestions for improvement, I will let you know. I used the older version for a while, but I only tinkered with it as I really didn't trust saving all my secrets on a palmtop. I am a DBA for a good sized educational institution, and we are almost paranoid about locking things down and not carrying passwords, pins, SSN's and the like around in laptops and PDA's. But this application looks really slick, so I am going to give it a try.
 
Thanks again,
 
Carl

Hi Carl,


That is great to hear.  When I read your previous mail I was thinking
that perhaps you had toggled the Backup bit on the database.  However
that should not break the system conduit - it should just skip it ...

I am glad that it all works now.

Please don't hesitate to write me if you have any other questions or
if you have ideas for enhancements of iSecur ...

Thanks for using iSecur.


Kind regards,
Brian
