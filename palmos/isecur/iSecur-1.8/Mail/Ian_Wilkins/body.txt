Here is how I get the problem:

I start by exporting my templates from "Secure It" to Memos.
I then delete the templates from Secure It.
I then use Sit2iSecur to copy the Secure It database to iSecur.
Then, from iSecur, I try to import the templates from Memos using
the options:
   "I/E" -> "Import"
>From the Import screen I select the templates Category (where I exported the Secure It templates to Memos).
I try clicking the "All" button at the bottom of the screen but it 
does not work so I check the boxes to select all my 5 templates.
I then click the "Import" button.
The "import Settings" screen appears:
    I select Import to: Templates
    I DON'T select "Delete after import"
    I DO select "Import as templates"

I then click the "Import" button.

The "Inport Status" box appears:
   It says: "0 Memo(s) was succesfully imported."  

I check iSecur and the templates have NOT been imported.

PS: I have approximately 160 records in Secure It/iSecur
