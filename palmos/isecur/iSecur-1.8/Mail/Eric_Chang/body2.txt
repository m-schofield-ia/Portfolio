Hi Brian,

Sorry to bother you again.  My device consistently
crashes in iSecur v1.4 when I open the password
generator in an editing screen (editing an existing
secret or creating a new secret), select length 20,
tap "Generate", and then tap "Use".  I haven't had a
chance yet to see if disabling other "hack-like"
programs such as KeyguardTime would fix it, but I
wanted to go ahead and let you know first.

Again, it's Palm OS v5.4.8 in case that's helpful.

Thanks!

Regards,
Eric
