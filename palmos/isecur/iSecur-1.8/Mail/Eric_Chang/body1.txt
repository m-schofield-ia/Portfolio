Hi Brian,

Thanks and congrats on such a useful tool as SecureIt.
 I was very happy to see the changes and enhancements
you made with iSecur, and I just wanted to point out a
behavior on iSecur's login screen.  I'm using version
1.3 on a Treo 650 running PalmOS 5.4.8, and when I
launch iSecur the password box has focus.  In other
words, the textbox has the PalmOS blue highlight
indicating that it can be selected with the center
navigation button, but the cursor isn't active inside
the textbox yet.  (Auto-capitalization, shift-lock,
and symbol-lock are all off.)  My password starts with
several numbers, so instinctively I press the symbol
key twice to turn on symbol-lock (but the behavior is
also the same if I press the shift key twice for
shift-lock).  Then as I type the first character in my
password, the textbox cursor becomes active, the blue
highlight around the textbox disappears, and the first
character gets entered into the textbox.  However, at
this point symbol-lock (or shift-lock) also goes away
automatically.  Is it possible to keep
symbol/shift-lock active until it's explicitly turned
off (with another press of the symbol or shift key)?

Thanks again!  This isn't a big problem for me, so
don't worry about it if other things are keeping you
busy.  I appreciate your work in any case!

Regards,
Eric

Thanks for pointing this out.  I downloaded it and
like the new preference options you've added.

Version 1.4, of course, has the same behavior on my
Treo 650, and I hope you eventually hit on the
solution; as I mentioned, though, it's not at all a
big deal for me.  Thanks anyway for keeping it in
mind!

One other thing I forgot to say: this is strictly my
personal opinion, but I think you should include the
"Help >> About" menu item on the login screen.  You
deserve credit (via the About screen) even if the user
hasn't logged into the secrets database yet!

Regards,
Eric
