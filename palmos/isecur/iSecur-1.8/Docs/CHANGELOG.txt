	this one has been going on since v1.0 :-)

v1.4 (2006-11-28)
	When doing a find inside iSecur the entire secret is searched.
	Fixed a bug where the Quick Find on the main list would bomb if a

	secret and you change the category you now have the option to stay in
	the category you're coming from.

	store the secret in the same category as the template.
	The function of the 5 way up/down can now be changed so that up/down
