iSecur
======

iSecur is a Personal Information Manager which let you store secrets safely.
iSecur is the successor of Secure It and provides stronger encryption (SHA256
and AES), icons, intelligent templates and more.

To use the secrets and templates from Secure It you must transfer them from
Secure It to iSecur using the Sit2iSecur application found on my website at:

	http://www.schau.com/

iSecur is released under the GNU General Public License v2.

iSecur and documentation can be found at:

Please read the ICONS.txt file before installing a icon set.
