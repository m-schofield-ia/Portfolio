Icons
-----

You can only install one icon set.   The set in 'std' is the standard icon
set provided with iSecur.
The icons in 'Ignacio_Sueiras' was kindly provided by Ignacio Sueiras
(<iknatius@iknatius.net>).

If you want to contribute icons to iSecur get in touch with me - my address
can be found in the README.txt file ...
