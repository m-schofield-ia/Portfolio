Someday this list will go online ...




* (BUG) Cannot handle Cyrillic

* (RFE) Integration with KeePass?

* (BUG) When I launch iSV, the window to select the profile does not show up -
the window to enter the password is the first one. I type the password but
there is "Load error" window saying "Arithmetical calculation generated a
overflow problem" (actually it says something like that in French). I'm running
iSV 1.4 and I have MS .NET installed. I've uninstalled iSV, cleaned the registry
and re-installed it but it remains the same.
