Hi Brian

No special characters  -- only numbers and letters.

They are and always have been in alpha order on my palmtreo through all
versions.

With the Isecure viewer they were in alpha order up until the currect
version 1.3.

Hope this helps.

Hi

I use your program and love it.

The new viewer 1.2 does not sort the entries alphbetically. Version 1.0
did.

Perhaps you could fix this.

Thanx

Fred
