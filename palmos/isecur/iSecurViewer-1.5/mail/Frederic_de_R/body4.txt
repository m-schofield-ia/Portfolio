Hi Brian,
 
Thanks for replying.
 
Regarding the error with iSV :
1. I use .NET 2.0
2. No there's no error code
 
See the pictures attached !

    Hi Frederic,

    No ...?!?!?    I've just browsed throught the spam folder, trash archive
    and inbox.  I have no trace of a mail from you from that date.

    >   1. When I launch iSV, the window to
    >   select the profile does not show up.

    The window will only show if you have more than one profile.  Generally,
    if you have one device you would normally only have one profile.

    >   2. The window to enter the password
    >   is the first one.

    Yes. If only one profile is present, iSV uses that (pr. default).

    >   3. I type the password but there is

    overflow

    Does it have an associated errorcode like: 0x80004abc (just an example!)?

    >   .NET installed. I've uninstalled iSV, cleaned the registry and
    re-installed it

    What version of .NET are you using?

    Yes, I know :-)   Translations will be a v1.5 or v1.6 thing.   I have some
    gui changes in v1.4/v1.5 which I want get out before accepting translations.
    That way it should mean lesser work for me and you (as a translator).
    I _hope_ to be able to totally empty the todo list around v1.6-v1.8 (unless
    too many bugs are reported)
    Then it will be time to stabilize (eg. only bug fix) and focus on a
    potential v2.0 release.   And to get tools like iSecurViewer up to date, I
    guess :-)


    > icon library and now there's a kind of black and white square or a maze.
    Is it the normal icon ?

    Yes. It is not a very beautiful icon so if you can do better or know some-
    one who can do better (and are willing to do an icon for free!) I'd like
    to know :-)

    > 3. One more report after my
    > to the category selection (up) or the "new" button (down). Is it supposed
    to be that way ?

    No. I think it is fixed in the yet-to-be-released v1.4 of iSecur.
    v1.4 is undergoing tests ... so hopefully it will be out next week.


    Kind regards,
    Brian
