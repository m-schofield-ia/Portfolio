Please read the following!

Sit2iSecur is used to copy your secrets and templates from Secure It to iSecur.

You are adviced to do this with an empty iSecur database but no damage will be done if you use a non-empty database.

No data will be deleted from your Secure It databases.

Sit2iSecur will attempt to create the same categories etc. in iSecur as present in Secure It.

If too many categories are present in Secure It then secrets belonging to those categories will be stored in the Unfiled category in iSecur.

Templates will be stored in iSecur in a category called Templates if it exists.
If it doesn't exist it will be created if possible - failing that, templates will be stored in the Unfiled category.


If you have not already done so, please launch iSecur and create a database.
