Name Search

The name search is a surname or a "surname givenname" search. Enter as much as possible of the surname or givenname and PFO will return the best matches.

Examples:

   Will return all persons with a surname starting with Schau.

2. schau br

   Will return all persons with a surname starting with Schau and a givenname starting with Br.

   Will look up the person with +45 2333 7836 (me! :-)

2. 4523337836
