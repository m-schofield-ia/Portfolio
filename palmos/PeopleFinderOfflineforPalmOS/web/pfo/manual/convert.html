</TR></TABLE>
<P>PeopleFinder Offline for Palm OS uses the original PeopleFinder Offline database as data input. However, to do so, you must convert the original database to a format suitable for PeopleFinder Offline for Palm OS.
<P>Here is how you do it ...
<P>(If a co-worker already has done this, then just get his/hers set of database files - it's much easier :-)

<P><BR><P>
<H3>Update PeopleFinder Offline</H3>
<P>Run the <B>Updater for PeopleFinder Offline</B> program from the original PeopleFinder Offline suite of programs. Make sure to check the <B>Full</B> and <B>PDA</B> boxes to download all the data. This will take a while the first time and you should be connected with LAN/Broadband.

<P><BR><P>
<H3>Convert Database</H3>
<P>Run the <B>Converter</B> program for the PeopleFinder Offline for Palm OS suite (pictures opens in separate windows).
<P><A HREF="javascript:OpenWindow(1)"><IMG SRC="gfx/wizard1s.jpg" WIDTH="136" HEIGHT="104" ALT="Wizard 1: Welcome screen"></A>
<P><BR>The welcome screen. Do as it says - update your PeopleFinder Offline database before running the conversion process.

<P><A HREF="javascript:OpenWindow(2)"><IMG SRC="gfx/wizard2s.jpg" WIDTH="136" HEIGHT="104" ALT="Wizard 2: Data Collection"></A>
<P><BR>Data Collection screen. Enter the full path to the PeopleFinder Offline database in the <B>PeopleFinder Offline Database</B> field (or use the <B>Browse...</B> button).
<P>Enter the output path in the <B>Palm Database Output Path</B> (or use the <B>Browse...</B> button).
<P>On Microsoft Windows you also have the choice to queue the database files for HotSync during the conversion. Tick the <B>Install to Palm Profile</B> checkbox and select the target profile in the drop down list.

<P><A HREF="javascript:OpenWindow(3)"><IMG SRC="gfx/wizard3s.jpg" WIDTH="136" HEIGHT="104" ALT="Wizard 3: Working ..."></A>
<P><BR>The conversion process takes a few minutes on my Evo N800c. On never models it takes a few seconds ...

<P><A HREF="javascript:OpenWindow(4)"><IMG SRC="gfx/wizard4s.jpg" WIDTH="136" HEIGHT="104" ALT="Wizard 4: Conversion Status"></A>
<P><BR>Everything usually runs smooth ... sometimes you get errors but then go back and retry the conversion process.

<P><BR><P>
<H3>What To Do Then?</H3>
<P>On Microsoft Windows you have the option to queue the database files for HotSync during the conversion process. Before HotSync'ing you may optionally move the database files to be installed to any SD/MMC card you may have attached to your handheld. Use the <B>Palm Install</B> tool for that. Then HotSync ...
<P>On non-Microsoft Windows you have to manually install the database file stored in the output path to your handheld by whatever means you normally uses to install prc/pdb files.
