2009-12-02	v3.0
	* Removed a very annoying bug where completing a level would still
	  mark it as failed.
	* Removed the Facebook an Twitter syncs. Nobody used them and I am
	  boycotting these two sites :-)

2009-08-21	v2.1
	* Fixed a couple of bugs which made iChains crash after some time.
	* Touch up on some of the graphics - smoother game.
