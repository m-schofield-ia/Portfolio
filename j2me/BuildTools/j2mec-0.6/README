j2mec
-----

j2mec is a tool to compile midlets.	j2mec is meant to be a all-in-one
tool which works in conjunction with Makefiles (yes, some of us still thinks
that Makefiles are great! :-)

j2mec gather it's instructions from a Build.properties file, then preprocesses
and compiles the source code.	The object code is then verified and placed
into an archive - lastly, a jad file is written.

The Build.properties file is used to tailer the various processes.

j2mec, manual etc.
