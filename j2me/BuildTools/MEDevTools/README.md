# MEDevTools
This is a collection of J2ME tools I use. Have a look in the MEDevTools.html for the full scoop.


# MetaCreator
The MetaCreator is used to generate the manifest file and the jad file.


# TrlClassCreator
TrlClassCreator can be used to create a Strings class files. The Strings class file can be used when localizing programs. Other means of doing the same is by using GNU GetText.
TrlClassCreator takes a set of strings and creates a java file with final identifiers.
Optionally, TrlClassCreater will overlay a set of strings on another set of strings and then output the combined set of strings.
