# Portfolio

This is my portfolio repository. It is basically a timeline of the stuff I've created during the years.

The portfolio contains the following sections:

  * [Amiga](amiga/)
  * [Android](android/)
  * [Commodore 64](c64/)
  * [iOS](ios/)
  * [J2ME](j2me/)
  * [Palm OS](palmos/)

If you fancy any of the source code grab yourself a copy. All source code has been released under the MIT license.

Have fun.
